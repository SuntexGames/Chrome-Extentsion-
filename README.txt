# Chrome-Extentsion-
A demo of a project I've been working on. 
Essentially its a version of "osu mania" which is like a game similar to guitar hero but in the form of a chrome extension. 
Currently I need to fix an FPS issue caused by the method I'm using for the program to read the "map" or the layout of the keys.
